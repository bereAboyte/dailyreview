            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born on February 20th 2000 at 
            the Community Medical Center in Fresno. 
            Some of my hobbies are going on Pinterest, 
            playing with my dogs and watching movies. 
            Some of my family members are my mom, my dad, 
            my sister, and my brother and my five dogs. </p>
            <p>My dream vacation would probably be in Hawaii 
            with the fam. We would go buy those stereotypical 
            Hawaiian shirts and eat pineapple. If I couldnâ€™t 
            go there, then I would want to go to London. 
            I would want to go because I would want to travel 
            out of the US.</p>
